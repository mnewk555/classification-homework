Matthew Newkirk UW FinTech Bootcamp Part-Time Feb. 2021 Unit 11 Homework - Classification

Finally got both notebooks finished and in some semblance of working order. I need to take more time to study how to properly format my y or taget values to use within the models; particularly, I'm not always certain on when to apply flattening (numpy array conversion) to my y. It will come in time, I might book a tutor session for this particular HW.

Also, I finished it super late, it is presently Saturday afternoon, quite a few days past the Tuesday night due date. I'm not too worried about the grade, just happy to see it through. I'm going to get started on the next unit's HW straight away so I don't end up in a similar pinch next week.
